To-Do:

1. Create a daemonset for the network policy controller
2. Handle the scenario for update/delete of a network policy
3. Use IP sets instead of individual iptable rules which does not scale so well
4. Reduce the usage of lists and dictionaries
5. Clean up rules on pod deletion or namespace deletion events
6. Handle corner cases where ports filed is empty or protocol is empty etc.
7. Properly delete the iptable rules from all nodes on deletion of network policy
8. Add a license file to the repo
9. Add a requirements.txt
10. Handle multiple network policy events
